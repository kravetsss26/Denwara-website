# Gemini Image Generation — Field Guide

How to generate photorealistic site images using Google Gemini via the CLI starter project.

---

## Setup

**Starter project location:**
```
/Users/ivan/Downloads/Клод сайти/google-image-gen-api-starter-main копія/
```

**API key** is already set in `.env` (not committed — see the starter project's own `.env`):
```
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Model:** `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`

No additional install needed — `uv sync` was already run.

---

## Basic Command

```bash
cd "/Users/ivan/Downloads/Клод сайти/google-image-gen-api-starter-main копія"

uv run python main.py "/absolute/path/to/output.jpg" "your prompt here" --aspect 3:4
```

**Aspect ratios:**

| Ratio  | Use for                        |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| `1:1`  | Square / Instagram             |
| `3:4`  | Portrait / gallery cards       |
| `4:3`  | Standard landscape             |
| `9:16` | Mobile / stories               |
| `16:9` | Hero banners, wide backgrounds |
| `21:9` | Ultra-wide cinematic           |

Always use an absolute path for the output file.

---

## Advanced Flags

```bash
# Edit an existing image
uv run python main.py output.jpg "Make the background white" --edit input.jpg

# Use a reference image to match a style
uv run python main.py output.jpg "Same composition but with a cat" --ref style.jpg

# Multiple reference images (up to 14)
uv run python main.py output.jpg "Same style" --ref ref1.jpg --ref ref2.jpg

# Use a style template (.md file with a Prompt Template section)
uv run python main.py output.jpg "a gear icon" --style styles/my_style.md
```

## Prompting Strategy

Gemini renders **specific detail** — it can produce readable text on objects, real place names, named people, exact dog breeds with exact cuts, and materials like marble or brass. This is what separates it from generic tools like Pollinations/Flux.

### The anatomy of a good prompt

```
[Subject] + [specific visual details] + [setting/context] + [lighting] + [camera style] + [quality suffix]
```

**Quality suffix to append to every prompt:**
```
ultra-realistic, professional photography, 4K, no text, no watermark
```

**Lighting terms that work:**
- `warm soft natural light from a window on the left`
- `soft overhead diffused light, no harsh shadows`
- `warm ambient light, golden hour`
- `editorial studio lighting on seamless beige backdrop`

**Key rules:**
- Name the **location** when it matters: "Châtillon, France", "Paris 13ème", "Sofia with Alexander Nevsky Cathedral visible"
- Name the **person** if they appear: "Olena, early 30s, friendly smile"
- Name **exact breeds** and **exact cuts**: "white toy poodle with perfect round fluffy Continental cut"
- Name **materials** specifically: "Carrara marble", "aged brass", "natural linen"
- Describe the **camera angle**: "flat lay top-down", "three-quarter view", "close-up portrait"

### What NOT to do
- Don't use vague adjectives alone: ~~"beautiful dog"~~ → "white Bichon Frise with cloud cut, sitting upright"
- Don't write ~~"luxury aesthetic"~~ without grounding it: → "warm pendant lamp over Carrara marble table, brass fittings"
- Don't omit the lighting: it determines whether the image looks editorial or stock

## Typical Workflow for a New Website Project

1. Identify every image slot in the design: hero, about, gallery cards, CTA, etc.
2. Note the aspect ratio needed for each slot.
3. Write prompts with the **specific context** of this client: their name, city, style, product/service.
4. Run all images via the CLI one by one (no batch script needed — just copy-paste).
5. Read each generated image with the Read tool immediately to verify quality.
6. If an image is wrong: fix the prompt (be more specific) and regenerate.

## Comparison vs Alternatives

| Tool             | Quality      | Text rendering | Specific details | Cost  |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Gemini (paid)    | Photorealistic | Yes          | Excellent        | Paid  |
| Pollinations/Flux | Generic stock | No           | Poor             | Free  |
| DALL-E 3         | Good          | Yes           | Good             | Paid  |

Gemini's key advantage: it follows long, highly detailed prompts and renders readable text (signs, labels, apron text) without hallucinating unrelated elements.
